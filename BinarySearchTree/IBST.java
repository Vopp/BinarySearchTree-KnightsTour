/**
 * A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree T such that each node N of T
 * stores an element e where: <br />
 * - elements stored at nodes in the left subtree of N are &le; e. <br />
 * - elements stored at nodes in the right subtree of N are &gt; e. <br />
 * The implementation of this BST assumes no duplicate elements; each element
 * can be inserted only once. Also, it is assumed that this BST is unbalanced.
 * <br /><br />
 * 
 * In the case of duplicate values for a specific element, we could use an
 * auxiliary data structure at a node, e.g. a linked list, to store all
 * values corresponding to that specific element. <br /><br />
 *
 * All elements inserted into the BST <strong>must</strong> implement the
 * Comparable interface. Furthermore, all such elements must be <it>mutually
 * comparable</it> (i.e. comparison is a total relation):
 * <tt>e1.compareTo(e2)</tt> must <strong>not</strong> throw a
 * <tt>ClassCastException</tt> for any elements <tt>k1</tt> and <tt>k2</tt> in
 * the BST. If the user attempts to put an element into the tree that violates
 * this constraint (for example, the user attempts to put a String element into
 * a BST whose elements are Integers), the <tt>put(E element)</tt> call will
 * throw a <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.
