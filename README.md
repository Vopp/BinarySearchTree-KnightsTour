# BinarySearchTree-KnightsTour
Two unrelated algorithms, well almost...

These two are a bit older, one implements algorithms for a binary search tree and the 2nd solves the "Knights tour"-problem of how to walk a Knight through every tile in a chessboard while only visiting each tile once. They're related by the focus on rekursion.
